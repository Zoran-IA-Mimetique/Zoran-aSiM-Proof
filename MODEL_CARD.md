Date: 2025-09-15T21:45:43.870147Z

## Intended Use
- Educational / reproducibility demonstration.
- Not for production or high-stakes use.

## Limitations
- Toy tasks only (ARC-like, mazes, sudoku).
- Energy proxy via psutil, not wattmeter.
- No comparative benchmarks vs SOTA.

## Metrics
- See metrics_humble_psutil.json, ablation_results.json.
- Seeds: 13 (others planned: 42, 101).

## Ethical Considerations
- Zero-Claim policy: no superiority claims without proof.
- ERRATA.md lists all retracted statements.
- Compliance evidence documents included, but external audit pending.

## Caveats
- Results here are prototypes, not final validated outputs.
