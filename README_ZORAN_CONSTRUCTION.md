# Zoran Construction — v20 (Flat)
Date: 2025-09-15T22:54:20.015942Z

Order of build (flat, no folders):
1. **GlyphNet** — base codec & schema (round‑trip, corpus‑agnostic).
2. **Python + GlyphNet** — bridge utilities for pipelines (encode/decode, file wrapping).
3. **HyperGlottal** — higher‑level semantic blocks (role, task, policy).
4. **QuantaGlottal** — quantized channels/tags for IA↔IA dense signalling.
5. **EURO‑5** — European operational profile (AI Act + RGPD + ISO42001 + eIDAS/C2PA) + checklist.

Each layer ships with: SPEC, schema (JSON), reference stubs, and tests.
Zero‑Claim policy applies: these artefacts are protocols & codecs, not performance claims.
