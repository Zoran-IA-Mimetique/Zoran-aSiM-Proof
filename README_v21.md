# Zoran v21 — Scientific Demonstration Extensions
Date: 2025-09-15T22:58:05.723024Z

## Additions
- **GlyphNet benchmark script** (`bench_glyphnet_vs_codecs.py`) → compare vs gzip/xz on .txt/.md files in root.
- **Multi-IA demo** (`multi_ia_demo.py`) → simulate Hyper/Quanta injection across agents, logs in `MULTI_IA_DEMO_LOG.json`.
- **EURO-5 Mapping** (`EURO5_MAPPING.md`) → crosswalk AI Act/ISO/RGPD → evidence files.

## Zero-Claim
These artefacts are designed to move from "specification" to "scientific demonstration":
- GlyphNet: compression results, size, time, reproducibility.
- Hyper/Quanta: multi-agent agreement rates.
- EURO-5: documentary mapping.

## Next
- Run `bench_glyphnet_vs_codecs.py` and attach BENCH_GLYPHNET_REPORT.json to evidence.
- Run `multi_ia_demo.py` multiple times (seeds) and compute agreement rate statistics.
- Provide EURO-5 checklist filled by auditor.
