## Addendum (PR) â€” Transparency on Benchmarks

- No benchmark numbers are published in this PR.  
- This repository enforces **Zero-Claim**: no superiority claims without public protocol + reproducible runs + artefacts (C2PA/SBOM).  
- Future comparative benchmarks will be run by **independent auditors** on public datasets; scripts and formats will be provided in a subsequent PR.
